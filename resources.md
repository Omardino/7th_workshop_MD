## Further simulation resources

- The [Living Journal of Computational Molecular Sciences](https://livecomsjournal.org/) is a journal 

- THe [Open Force Field Initiative](https://openforcefield.org/) includes many resources for easily parameterizing a wide range of molecular systems, including [tutorials](https://docs.openforcefield.org/projects/toolkit).

- [AmberTools](https://ambermd.org/) is a software suite for creating Amber topologies, including the popular tleap approach.

- i-CoMSE has run a online [workshop intrpducing advanced sampling techniques](https://github.com/icomse/3rd_workshop_advanced_sampling), ways to increase the
 rate that molecular simulations visit the high-probability configurational esembles that are kinetically separated, and the videos, slides, and code for these are available at the link above.

- Bootstrapping is a robust technique for estimating uncertainties in calculations without assuming that the distributions are Gaussian or doing messy calculus.
  We didn't quite get to it this time, but [have an earlier i-CoMSE tutorial on this technique](https://github.com/icomse/mcmd_summer_2022/blob/main/bootstrapping/README.md)
